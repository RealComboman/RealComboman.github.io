			<p>JewelCrush is a puzzle game that takes the form of a grid of 8 squares out of 8 containing stones of different colors. The goal of the game is to group them by color in groups of 3 or more, horizontally or vertically, inverting two adjacent gems each time.<br/></p>
			<p>When they are aligned, they disappear, and the ones above them fall, revealing new gems. You will earn bonus points if you manage to align more than 3 identical stones. As the gems fall, it's possible for them to align, causing a chain reaction that will also earn you bonus points. The more chains you create in a row, the more points you'll earn.</p>
			<p><img src="ore/images/sprites/bomb.png">After a certain number of chains, you will be able to see a bonus object appear on your grid, a <b>candy bomb</b> which will allow you to destroy all the surrounding gems.</p>
			<p><br/>You have 3 minutes to reach the required number of points at each level.</p>
			<p>You will have lost the game if you fail to complete the level within the allotted time, or if no more combinations are possible on your grid.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:30px;"><strong>Need help?</strong> If you get stuck on a level, don't panic, you'll be given a hint after a certain amount of inactivity.</p>
